# Hi, I'm Gabriel! 👋🚀


## 👨‍💻 About Me
I am an advanced student of mechatronic engineering with knowledge and experience in a wide range of technologies.
Expected to graduate in July 2025
I am a self-motivated, curious person with a great desire to learn and improve as a professional

👩‍💻 I am currently working on improving the speed and quality of scientific research at my university through a solution that uses CNNs to detect and count microalgae in microscopic images with great precision and speed.

🧠 I am currently learning to design and program CNNs with YOLO architecture using PyTorch

👯‍♀️ I am looking to collaborate on a project that will challenge me and allow me to improve in some of the technologies I already know. I am also open to projects that allow me to learn new technologies.

⚡️ Random fact about me: I'm passionate about technology and I also love the arts. It's only natural that if I'm not programming, I'm learning and writing about paintings, artists, poems, and music.
